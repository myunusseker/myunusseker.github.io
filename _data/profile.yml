  <p>
    Hi! I’m a Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">The Robotics Institute, 
    Carnegie Mellon University</a>, where I’m fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/oliver-kroemer/" target="_blank">Prof. Oliver Kroemer</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research focuses on building intelligent robotic systems that can <strong>learn complex skills and generalize them to new environments with zero to minimal supervision</strong>. I develop algorithms for <strong>robot learning</strong>, with an emphasis on <em>skill acquisition and transfer</em>, <em>action-effect prediction</em>, <em>affordance understanding</em>, and <em>learning from demonstration</em>. I'm particularly interested in combining <strong>robot manipulation</strong> with <em>deep learning</em>, <em>perception</em>, <em>foundational models</em>, <em>LLM/VLMs</em>, <em>symbolic reasoning</em> and <em>data-efficient optimization techniques</em> to enable robots to adapt quickly and robustly to real-world scenarios.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ultimately, my goal is to bridge the gap between low-level control and high-level reasoning—empowering robots to understand, plan, and act in ways that are as versatile and intuitive as humans.
  </p>
