    Robots need to estimate the material and dynamic properties of objects from observations in order to simulate them accurately. We present a Bayesian optimization approach to identifying the material property parameters of objects based on a set of observations. Our focus is on estimating these properties based on observations of scenes with different sets of interacting objects. We propose an approach that exploits the structure of the reward function by modeling the reward for each observation separately and using only the parameters of the objects in that scene as inputs. The resulting lower-dimensional models generalize better over the parameter space, which in turn results in a faster optimization. To speed up the optimization process further, and reduce the number of simulation runs needed to find good parameter values, we also propose partial evaluations of the reward function, wherein the selected parameters are only evaluated on a subset of real world evaluations. The approach was successfully evaluated on a set of scenes with a wide range of object interactions, and we showed that our method can effectively perform incremental learning without resetting the rewards of the gathered observations.
short_abstract: This paper introduces a Bayesian optimization framework to estimate object material properties from observed interactions. By modeling each observation independently and focusing only on relevant object parameters, the method achieves faster, more generalizable optimization. It further improves efficiency through partial reward evaluations, enabling robust and incremental learning across diverse real-world scenes.
