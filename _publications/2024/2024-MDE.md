   Optimizing robotic action parameters is a significant challenge for manipulation tasks that demand high levels
    of precision and generalization. Using a model-based approach,
    the robot must quickly reason about the outcomes of different
    actions using a predictive model to find a set of parameters that
    will have the desired effect. The model may need to capture the
    behaviors of rigid and deformable objects, as well as objects
    of various shapes and sizes. Predictive models often need to
    trade-off speed for prediction accuracy and generalization. This
    paper proposes a framework that leverages the strengths of
    multiple predictive models, including analytical, learned, and
    simulation-based models, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy
    of action parameter optimization. Our approach uses Model
    Deviation Estimators (MDEs) to determine the most suitable
    predictive model for any given state-action parameters, allowing
    the robot to select models to make fast and precise predictions.
    We extend the MDE framework by not only learning sim-to-real
    MDEs, but also sim-to-sim MDEs. Our experiments show that
    these sim-to-sim MDEs provide significantly faster parameter
    optimization as well as a basis for efficiently learning sim-toreal MDEs through finetuning. The ease of collecting sim-to-sim
    training data also allows the robot to learn MDEs based directly
    on visual inputs and local material properties.
short_abstract: This paper presents a framework that optimizes robotic actions by choosing between multiple predictive models—analytical, learned, and simulation-based—based on context. Using Model Deviation Estimators (MDEs), the robot selects the most reliable model to quickly and accurately predict outcomes. The introduction of sim-to-sim MDEs enables faster optimization and smooth transfer to real-world tasks through fine-tuning.
